## About
I wanted a theme that met these requirements:
* Look nice with FixedsysExcelsior, or any monospaced bitmap font (no font-smoothing, same font-size at all times)
* Have a dark background
* Keep the same vertical spacing between messages (notices, general events, etc)
* Have the timestamp on the left side
* Have no vertical spacing between paragraphs (obligatory for ASCII art)
* NOT have nick indentation or a marker line that divides the nickname from the message

I couldn't find one that had all those features so I created *Fixedstyle*, based on [textual-solarized-dark](https://github.com/Xorcode/textual-solarized-dark).

Bold text is shown as a glowing text instead of forced bold to keep the typography intact.

## Installation
* Unzip the [zip](https://github.com/iiiGerardoiii/Fixedstyle/archive/master.zip)
* Move unzipped folder to the Textual custom styles folder.
* Open Textual preferences (`âŒ˜+,`) go to Styles and select Fixedstyle.
