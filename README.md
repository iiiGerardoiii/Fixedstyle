# Fixedstyle theme for Textual

## Warning
This theme was made for non-retina displays. If you're using a retina display or any HiDPI display, this might not be the theme for you because Fixedsys upscaled 2x its size doesn't look good. But that's just my opinion you be the judge.

## What is this?
Fixedstyle is a theme for [Textual](https://www.codeux.com/textual/), an IRC client for OS X.

I wanted a theme that met these requirements:
* Look nice with FixedsysExcelsior (no font-smoothing, always 16px, etc)
* Have a dark background (with a nice complementary nick color scheme surewhynot)
* Have the same height from message to message (notices, general events, etc)
* Have the timestamp on the left side
* NOT have nick indentation or a marker line that divides the nickname from the message

I couldn't find one that had all those features so I created *Fixedstyle*, based on [textual-solarized-dark](https://github.com/Xorcode/textual-solarized-dark).

## Main Features
**FixedsysExcelsior 3.01-L2 used as main font:**
The style was made to be used exclusively with this legendary font. Bold text is shown as a glowing text instead of forced bold, to keep the typography intact. *(__FSEX301-L2.ttf__ comes included with the style and it automatically uses it, so don't worry if you don't have it installed.)*

**Base16 Color Scheme:**
Nicknames, notices, highlights, and other messages are colored with the beautiful [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) color scheme by [chriskempson](https://github.com/chriskempson).

## Installation
* Unzip the [zip](https://github.com/iiiGerardoiii/Fixedstyle/archive/master.zip)
* Move unzipped folder to the [Textual custom styles folder](https://d.maxfile.ro/mwdvbtannn.html)
* Open Textual preferences (`âŒ˜+,`) go to Styles and select Fixedstyle.
